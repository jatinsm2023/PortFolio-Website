I want you to build a highly interactive Portfolio Website for me that looks and behaves exactly like a MacOS Desktop.

Tech Stack:

React (Vite)

Tailwind CSS (for styling)

Framer Motion (for animations, draggable windows, and opening/closing effects)

Lucide-React (for icons)

Core Design & Layout:

Background: A high-quality abstract MacOS-style wallpaper.

Top Menu Bar: -   Left: Apple Logo (opens a small dropdown with "Restart", "Sleep", "Shut Down"), and the text "Jatin Mahawar".

Right: Current Time (ticking), Date, Wifi Icon, Battery Icon, and a Control Center toggle.

The Dock (Bottom):

A glass-morphism dock at the bottom of the screen containing app icons.

Icons should have a "magnification" effect on hover (scale up slightly).

Apps to include: Finder (About), VS Code (Experience/Skills), Safari (Projects), Terminal (CLI), Mail (Contact), and Photos.

Window Manager:

When an app icon is clicked, it should open a "Window".

Windows must be draggable (using framer-motion drag controls).

Windows should have the standard Mac "Traffic Light" buttons (Red to close, Yellow to minimize, Green to expand) on the top left.

Windows should have a glass-morphism sidebar and a white content area.

Clicking a window brings it to the front (z-index management).

If a window is minimized, it shrinks back to the dock.

App Specific Content (Use this JSON Data):

1. Finder (About Me & Education):

Sidebar: "Recents", "Desktop", "Downloads".

Content Area: A clean profile view.

Profile Info:

Name: Jatin Mahawar

Tagline: "Founding Engineering Intern @ CallKaro AI | IIT Kharagpur '27"

Bio: "I am a dual degree student at IIT Kharagpur specializing in Computer Science. I have experience building Gen AI SaaS platforms, real estate tech, and compilers. I love solving complex problems with code."

Education Folder: -   IIT Kharagpur (2022-2027): B.Tech (Hons) + M.Tech in CSE. CGPA: 8.54/10.

Class XII: 94.20% | Class X: 82.67%.

Resume File: Create a file icon labeled "Resume.pdf" that opens my PDF link (use a placeholder link for now).

2. VS Code (Experience & Skills):

UI: Make it look like the VS Code editor. Sidebar with file tree. Main area with code syntax highlighting.

File 1: experience.json:

    "role": "Founding Engineering Intern",
    "company": "CallKaro AI",
    "duration": "Dec 2024 - Jun 2025",
    "details": [

      "Integrated Hybrid RAG using Azure OpenAI & NumPy vectors.",
      "Handled 60K+ calls/messages with React Infinite Scroller & WebSockets."
    ]
  },
  {
    "role": "Full Stack Developer",
    "company": "iProp91",
    "duration": "Aug 2024 - Oct 2024",
    "details": [

      "Built secure OTP auth using OTPLESS & JWT.",
      "Implemented group chat via WebSockets for customers & advocates."
    ]
  }
]


File 2: skills.js:

const skills = {
  languages: ["C", "C++", "Python", "Assembly", "Verilog", "JavaScript"],
  web: ["React.js", "Node.js", "Express.js", "Tailwind CSS", "HTML/CSS"],
  data_ai: ["NumPy", "Pandas", "RAG", "Azure OpenAI", "Mistral AI"],
  tools: ["Git", "Docker", "Azure", "MongoDB", "PostgreSQL", "Redis"]
};


3. Safari (Projects):

UI: Browser interface with a search bar (showing my github: https://www.google.com/search?q=github.com/jatinsm2023).

Content: a Grid of "Website Cards" for my projects.

Projects Data:

MailKaro: "FastAPI & SMTP platform for mass mailing. Used Mistral AI for content variation to reduce spam. Doubled NGO donations."

Tiny-C Compiler: "Machine-independent compiler built with Bison/Flex. Translates C to 3-address code."

LLMSQL: "LLM-powered system translating natural language to SQL. Fine-tuned Mistral-7B."

CallKaro AI: "Gen AI SaaS for automated business calls."

Each card should have a "Visit GitHub" button linking to https://github.com/jatinsm2023.

4. Terminal:

A black window with green text.

Allow users to type commands like help, whoami, clear, contact.

whoami returns: "Jatin Mahawar - CSE Student at IIT KGP".

5. Mail (Contact):

UI: A clean email composition window.

To: jatinmahawar08@gmail.com (Pre-filled).

Subject: (User input).

Body: (User input).

"Send" button should trigger a mailto: link.

Please ensure the app is responsive, but optimized primarily for Desktop viewing (since it's a desktop OS simulator). Mobile users should see a simplified version or a message asking to view on Desktop.
